# TextChat

A plugin that adds text chat into proximity chat, and optionally, global chats too.

## Features:
- Allows users to send chats that people in proximity can see.
- Allows messages to be blocked if they don't meet a certain criteria.
- Proximity chat messages will consistently look at the player so that they can be read at any angle.

### Optional features (provided by other downloadable modules/plugins from this repository):
- Show messages inside global channels like SCP and Spectator utilising hints.
- Modify hint locations

To be able to get these optional features as mentioned above, please install TextChat.RueI, this will require the hint framework RueI for this to work as well. In the future I do plan on adding HintServiceMeow support,
so if you are interested in that, keep an eye out!

## Extra Info
This plugin tries to be as customisable as possible, but possibly has flaws for it's initial versions. If you have any issues please make a GitHub issue.

## Developers:
Hi developers! 

With this plugin I wanted to make it super simple for you all to add your own integrations to this, like how I do with some of my other plugins.

Here there is a plentiful list of events within TextChat.Events that you can hook onto, all allowing you to do your own things.

I hope to make this even more customisable in the future, so keep an eye out for that!
